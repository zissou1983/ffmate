FFmate is an automation layer built on top of [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), designed not only to simplify transcoding but also to serve as an **extensible engine for custom media workflows**. It provides developers with the tools to integrate FFmpeg's power into their applications and services through a comprehensive REST API, event-driven webhooks, and scriptable pre/post-processing hooks.

If you're looking to build custom media processing pipelines, integrate transcoding into your existing systems, or develop tools that leverage FFmpeg, FFmate provides the foundation.

## ‚ú® Core Features for Extensibility

FFmate is built with extensibility in mind. Here's how you can leverage its core components:

- **REST API** ‚Äì Submit and manage FFmpeg tasks programmatically  
- **Web UI** ‚Äì Monitor and control jobs in real time, no terminal required  
- **Watchfolders** ‚Äì Automatically process files dropped into a directory  
- **Presets** ‚Äì Ready-made set of pre-configured transcoding presets for common use cases  
- **Webhooks** ‚Äì Get real-time notifications for task events  
- **Dynamic Wildcards** ‚Äì Automate file naming and folder structures  
- **Pre/Post Processing** ‚Äì Run custom scripts before or after each task to automate complex workflow steps
- **Built-in Queue** ‚Äì Manage task execution with priority control and smart concurrency handling

## üöÄ Getting Started for Developers

To start extending, integrating with, or contributing to FFmate:

### Prerequisites

*   **FFmpeg:** Installed and in `$PATH`.
*   **Go (Golang):** Version 1.24+ (or specify your project's minimum version). Required for building from source or contributing to core.
*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.
*   Familiarity with REST APIs and JSON.
*   Your preferred scripting language (Python, Bash, Node.js, etc.) for pre/post-processing scripts.

### Installation & Setup

You have two main options:

1.  **Use Pre-compiled Binaries (for integration/extension):**
    *   Download the latest binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/welovemedia/ffmate/releases).
    *   Make executable: `chmod +x ffmate`
    *   (Optional) Move to a directory in your `$PATH`.
    *   Run FFmate Server: `./ffmate server`

2.  **Build from Source (for core contribution/deep customization):**
    *   **Clone the repository:**
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/welovemedia/ffmate.git
        cd ffmate
        ```
    *   **Install Go dependencies:**
        ```bash
        go mod tidy
        # or go get ./...
        ```
    *   **Build the FFmate binary:**
        ```bash
        go build -o ffmate main.go
        ```
        The compiled `ffmate` binary will be in the root of the `ffmate` directory.
    *   **Run FFmate Server:**
        ```bash
        ./ffmate server
        # For development, consider enabling debug for relevant namespaces:
        # ./ffmate server --debug="api:webhook:queue:ffmpeg:sev"
        ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Key Extension Points - Quick Reference

*   **Integrating with an existing application?**
    *   Start with the `/api/v1/tasks` endpoint to submit jobs.
    *   Use `/api/v1/webhooks` to get status updates back to your application.
*   **Need custom logic around transcoding?**
    *   Implement pre/post-processing scripts.
    *   Define `scriptPath` and `sidecarPath` in your task/preset API calls.
*   **Building a custom dashboard or UI?**
    *   The entire Web UI is built on the public REST API and WebSockets. You can do the same!
    *   WebSockets (served from `/ws` on the same port) provide real-time updates for tasks and logs.
*   **Automating complex ingestion workflows?**
    *   Use the `/api/v1/watchfolders` endpoint combined with presets that trigger your custom processing logic.

**Code Structure:**

*   **`main.go`**: Main application entry point, CLI command parsing (using Cobra), server initialization.
*   **`/internal/`**: Core application logic, not intended for direct import by other projects.
    *   **`/controller/`**: HTTP request handlers (e.g., using Gin). This is where API routes are defined and map to services.
    *   **`/services/`**: Business logic for each major feature (Tasks, Presets, Watchfolders, Webhooks). Services orchestrate operations, interact with the database, and call core components.
    *   **`/dto/`**: A folder holding all Data Transfer Objects.
    *   **`/queue/`**: Manages the task queue, concurrency, and task lifecycle.
    *   **`/interceptor/`**: Interceptors to use with Gin for various routes.
    *   **`/middleware/`**: Global middleware being used by Gin.
    *   **`/metrics/`**: Manages and exposes prometheus metrics for later scraping.
    *   **`/ffmpeg/`**: Wrapper around the `ffmpeg` binary, responsible for executing commands, parsing progress, and handling output/errors.
    *   **`/database/`**: Database models/structs (e.g., for GORM if used) and database interaction logic (repository pattern).
    *   **`/config/`**: Application configuration management.
    *   **`/utils/`**: Common utility functions.
*   **`/pkg/`**: Libraries intended to be used by external applications (if any). (Your current docs don't suggest FFmate is used as a library itself, mostly as a standalone server).
*   **`/ui/`** or **`/web/dist/`**: Contains the pre-built static assets for the Web UI.
*   **`/docs/`**: Your Markdown documentation.
*   **`go.mod`, `go.sum`**: Go module files.

**Key Extension & Contribution Areas:**

*   **API Handlers (`/internal/controller/`):** Extend existing API endpoints or add new ones.
*   **Services (`/internal/services/`):** Modify or add business logic for features.
*   **Core Logic (`/internal/ffmpeg/`):** Enhance task processing, FFmpeg interaction, or pre/post-script handling.
*   **Web UI (`/ui/`):** The ffmate-ui repository as submodule.
